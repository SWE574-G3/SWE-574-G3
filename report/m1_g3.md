**1.5. Overview**

The document begins with a broad overview of the product, outlining its purpose and core features. It then details specific requirements, covering user interactions, product functionality, and system operations. Additionally, it addresses external interfaces, design constraints, performance expectations, and quality attributes, providing a comprehensive scope of the platform's requirements.

**2\. Overall Descriptions** 

**2.1. Product Perspective**

The platform is a web-based community system allowing users to create, join, and engage in communities around shared interests. Key features include user profiles, content posting, and interaction within communities. It integrates a recommendation engine to suggest relevant communities and content, and an activity feed for real-time updates on user actions. The system follows a three-tier architecture (frontend, backend, and database) and interacts with external services such as the Wikidata API for tagging and cloud services for hosting.

**2.2. User Characteristics**

**General Users:** Registered individuals who can create posts, join public communities, and interact with other users through comments, likes, and other engagement options. General users are also able to subscribe to and receive recommendations for communities based on their interests. They may interact with platform features like upvoting, commenting, and following posts in subscribed communities.

**Community Creators:** Users who initiate the creation of new communities. They are responsible for defining community details such as name, description, and post templates. Creators set the privacy status (public or private) of the community and establish initial rules. They also have control over member management, including inviting or removing users and transferring their "Creator" role if needed.

**Moderators:** Appointed within communities to help oversee interactions and maintain quality standards. Moderators can manage posts and comments, remove inappropriate content, and address reported issues from users within their community. They assist in enforcing community guidelines and supporting healthy engagement.

**Administrators (Owners):** Users with advanced permissions and responsibilities across communities. Administrators oversee community operations, including user management, role assignment (e.g., promoting or demoting users to/from moderators), and overall community settings. They ensure smooth operation of the community, managing permissions to create a safe and engaging space for members.

**SOFTWARE DESIGN (DIAGRAMS)**

**1\. Software Design for Recommendation Engine, Class and Sequence Diagrams**

Design documents can be found on the wiki page for a better reading experience.

[https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/wiki/Design-Representations#software-design-for-recommendation-engine-class-and-sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/wiki/Design-Representations#software-design-for-recommendation-engine-class-and-sequence-diagrams)

**1.1 Design Philosophy**

This part of the design covers the proposed approach to implement a recommendation engine and activity stream for the application. In order to achieve recommendation engine goal, application needs certain semantic labelling activities to collect and match user interests. With this in mind, recommendation engine design is splitted into two parts;

*   Interest Management (Collecting and/or removing user interests and community labels)
    
*   Recommendation Engine (Matching collected interests with other labels/interests)
    

Activity stream on the other is another feature introduced to the application. The design for the activity stream was rather simple compared to the recommendation engine. The main idea is to collect logs of user’s significant actions in the community, then visualize those actions to the user to enhance the interaction.

**1.1.1 Interest Management**

Collection of interests or labels can be achieved at two particular states for both users and communities. For ease of explanation, users and communities will be referred as "entities" from this point on. These two states are "at the creation of entity" and "after entity is created". On the front-end of the application, users will be allowed to add labels/interests to at the entity creation. In addition, such "tags" can also be added and removed after entity is created. Achieving consistency for labels is not a trivial task since there needs to be a vast library for them with certain ids. Creating such a library is possible during the lifecycle of the application, yet not very feasible. For this reason, Wikidata will be utilized for semantic labelling. Wikidata contains unique codes for each potential item and provides a "parent-subclass" system to relate items that have shares certain characteristics, allowing the application to provide users a wider range of recommendations. One particular constraint applied to the design is that, in order to achieve consistency, users will not be able to create "free-text" labels/interests for entities. They will use the free-text to search for relevant items in the Wikidata library and add the items found. Utilizing such approach, application will be able to collect and store interests/labels in a consistent way, leveraging the unique codes provided by Wikidata API.

**1.1.2 Recommendation Engine**

Considering the "Interest Management" section, it is assumed that the application already has a functioning way to collect and store the semantic labels. At this point, only requirement left is to match the semantic labels to provide recommendations to the user. As already hinted, application will store the interests for users and labels for communities in the database, which are retrieved as explained in "Interest Management" section. Thus, for each user, recommendation engine in the backed will be able query user interests first, and then query for those interests among the communities using the unique codes to find the matching ones. Importance of Wikidata unique codes are revealed at this step, interests for users and labels for communities needs to be the same in order to match. It would not be easy if application used free-text instead of Wikidata unique codes. To carry this flow one step further, application aims to widen the range of recommendations presented to a user, implementing a way to "guess" the user interests that are not explicitly defined by the users. Thus, it is considered to utilize "parent-subclass" tree of the Wikidata API. It is possible to obtain the parent classes of the interests provided by the user. Content that matches the unique codes of parent classes can also be added to the list of recommendations. However, there is a risk of overachieving here, as the subclass tree might be very deep. For this reason, it is decided to keep the lookup level to only one (1) level.

**1.1.3 Activity Stream**

The activity feed in this project is designed to keep users informed about significant interactions within their community, creating a dynamic and personalized experience. The system logs key actions, such as creating posts, commenting, and liking content, and presents them in a timeline that displays the most recent actions at the top. To maintain privacy, only registered members of a specific community can view the feed. Users can also filter the feed by action type, allowing them to focus on specific updates like posts or comments. In addition, the system stores historical logs, enabling users to browse past activities and stay informed about important community developments.

The core concept of the activity engine is to create a database that logs each significant user interaction, such as commenting on a post, liking a post, joining the library, or creating a new post in the library. These actions will be linked to existing endpoints that record the user performing the action, the action itself, and the target of the action in the database. By running queries, the application can display activities with a focus on who performed the action, what the action was, and which component (such as a community or post) was involved.

**1.2 Diagrams**

Post recommendation sequence diagrams are not included as they are expected to have the identical or very similar workflow to the community recommendation steps.

**Scenario:**

Selim decided to join the community management platform on his mobile phone. After registration, he was presented a screen that asks for him to pick his interests. After his choices, he is landed to the home page with recommendations are listed alongside with home-page items. He sees a post about upcoming cars in 2025 with a community name "Car Lovers" that takes his interest and enters the community. He joins the community and decides to click the button "interests" which orders the posts according to his interests. He also sees another button about activities and presses to see what other community members are doing.

**Recommendation Mockup**

**Screen 1: Choosing Interests**

New user Selim is presented with a window that is mandatory to proceed with registration. He types "DOGS" first and before entering his second "car" he is also presented some options to related words through dropdown menu. Similar words are taken from Wikidata.

**PROJECT PLAN**

**Approach on Organizational Plan:**

As a team, we have decided to divide and isolate the relevant tasks together as a bundle and assign them to a particular team member. Since all features in itself require a workflow(design=>implementation=>iteration) and series of decisions, having multiple members working on the same feature has the potential to cause a lot of conflicts, both on ideas on how things should work and the code developed. This would cause inefficiencies and result in waste of time in a relatively tight schedule. Additionally, such an approach could allow members to express themselves more freely in the work they do, as they are responsible for the feature from scratch. One drawback of this model reveals itself when a member struggles to fulfill the task, since that member would be the only person responsible. In order to avoid this problem, we have decided to be more flexible on volunteering to help a team member and share the tasks when such difficulties arise.

**Approach on Roadmap:**

Initially, we wanted to be very clear on what and how we implement since we wanted to avoid loopbacks that could be extremely time consuming. Thus, at the start, we mainly focused on the software and database design, considering all the components of the application and customer requirements.As for planning the project management activities, we have aligned on rules for pull requests, issue templates and weekly meetings.

As for the development timeline, we have decided to set relatively ambitious goals, relying on the plan and the design previously made. Overall, our aim is to be “almost finished” around the MVP submittal date (November 25th). Completing all the major features like recommendation system and activity stream until the MVP submittal would give us a lot of room to review the work we have done and improve the areas that might need attention. Additionally, all team would be in a much more peaceful state of mind, further contributing to our working ecosystem.

Another important point is the fact that we have decided to develop the front-end and backend simultaneously. This is a fundamentally different approach some of the team members embraced in the last semester. However, considering that we have a working software to start with as opposed to the last semester and that the members are assigned to different features, such a decision was easily agreed within the team. Team members responsible for a specific feature will implement the tasks full-stack, allowing them to connect the dots between the front-end and backend. This approach is expected to result in less friction between team members and smooth continuation of the milestones as the tasks will be isolated and bundled.

Specifics of the milestones and timeline can be found in the link below.

[https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due\_date&state=open](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open)

**COMMUNICATION PLAN**

At the beginning of the course, we recognized the importance of staying well-connected and decided to create a WhatsApp group to ensure consistent communication and keep each other updated throughout the project. This platform allows us to quickly share updates, ask questions, and notify the team about any ongoing work. Alongside the group chat, we also hold weekly meetings to discuss the project's progress. Although we don't have a fixed schedule for these meetings, they usually take place once a week and can last anywhere from one to two hours, depending on the topics we need to cover.

During these meetings, we address critical aspects of the project such as coding standards, design decisions, the overall roadmap, and the prioritization of features. These discussions help us maintain alignment and ensure that we're all working toward the same goals. Outside of the meetings, we use our WhatsApp group to notify each other when we begin working on an issue, when we create a pull request, and when we are reviewing someone else's pull request. This communication plan allows for seamless collaboration, ensuring that everyone is informed, tasks are coordinated efficiently, and no important details are missed.

**WEEKLY REPORTS AND ANY ADDITIONAL MEETING NOTES**

All weeks meeting notes are available on Wiki:

https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/wiki/Meeting-Notes

Here’s your revised version with improved clarity and flow:

**Week 1:**

This week, we discussed the recommendation system and decided to prioritize tag-based and similar activity recommendations while avoiding location-based suggestions and preventing recommendation loops that only favor popular content. We also explored strategies to engage new users and ensure they aren’t overlooked. For user incentives, we opted to implement a reward system focused on quality contributions, using badges or ranks, and discussed methods to prevent system abuse. Additionally, we reviewed the differences between mobile and web platforms, deciding that community creation will primarily be web-based, while mobile will focus on user interaction. Finally, we outlined the activity stream setup for tracking actions and generating notifications.

We also established the project repository, issue templates, wiki structure, and drafted the initial project requirements.

**Notes:** [Meeting 1 Notes](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/wiki/Meeting-Notes#meeting-1)

**Week 2:**

This week, we finalized our decision on which front-end technology to use. Tasks were divided for creating mock-up screens for the Recommendation System and Activity Stream. We also assigned responsibilities for handling the Mobile Requirements, Activity Stream Requirements, and Recommendation System Requirements.

By the end of the week, we successfully deployed the application locally to prepare for development. Requirements and mock-up screens were created according to the assigned tasks.

**Week 3:**

Before the start of the week, we held discussions on the implementation of the recommendation engine. Following some tips and insights, we conducted research on WikiData integration. Relevant information can be found in the meeting notes: [Meeting 3 Notes](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/wiki/Meeting-Notes#meeting-3)

We also discussed user interests, database design, and the scope and implementation of the recommendation system.

Throughout the week, team members refined mock-up screens, prepared ER diagrams and UML diagrams for system design, and finalized the repository infrastructure by defining coding standards and commit guidelines.

**Week 4:**

This week, we revisited our design decisions and realized that some needed refinement. Communication issues arose, leading us to consider improving or changing our communication platform.

We also received feedback from the instructor regarding the recommendation engine and discussed adjustments to our approach.

Existing mock-ups were refined, the scenario for the presentation was enhanced, and additional mock-ups were created to better illustrate planned functionalities. Missing design documents for the Activity Stream and Recommendation Engine were completed.

We deployed the current project for the presentation and prepared the application by populating it with data aligned with our presentation scenario.

**INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS**

**GROUP 3:**

**Member:** Ahmet Dolma

**Responsibilities:** 

I have responsibilities that include managing user profiles by editing and updating information, assigning roles such as users, owners, and moderators to ensure proper functionality and role-based access within the system. Additionally, I oversee the organization and moderation of the community by ensuring that each role aligns with the required permissions and responsibilities. This ensures a smooth and efficient user experience across the platform. ([Issue 47](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/47),[Issue 48](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/48))

**Main Contributions:** First, I was responsible for revising the [readme](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/wiki/Requirements#activity-feed-requirements) page. I have also contributed in the process of creating [AFR](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/wiki/Requirements#activity-feed-requirements)(activity feed requirements) for the activity stream, then also I created 

**Non-Code Related Significant Issues:** 

I have created and revised  our [read me page](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/4) .Specifically, I was responsible for creating the sequence diagram, as noted in [Issue #20](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/20), which detailed the interactions between different components of the Activity Feed and illustrated how user actions are processed within the system. Furthermore, I worked on the class diagram for the Activity Feed, documented in [Issue #19](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/19). This diagram provided a clear overview of the classes involved and their relationships, helping to streamline the development and ensure the system’s scalability and maintainability.

Also, the design representations I created can be accessed through below links.

**Member:** Cankut Er

**Responsibilities:** 

I have three major responsibilities in the project. 

*   As the project is initialized based off my repository from the last semester, I help the team members navigate the repository, explain them the current codebase and inform the about the strengths and weaknesses to prevent problems from leaking into the new versions. Additionally, I actively participated into designing (both database and software) the new features, including the ones I am not responsible for, as the design is the continuation of the work done in the last semester and it made sense for me to explain how to integrate new design into the old one.
    
*   My main responsibility in the project is to design and implement the recommendation system. This task includes both front-end and backend development. I assume I will be working on the system for the majority of the semester.
    
*   I have taken the responsibility to handle deployment of the project (containerization and cloud navigation) as I am familiar with such tasks working as a DevOps Engineer in my professional career.
    

**Main Contributions:** 

Links to the relevant sources will be shared in the issues section.

*   Creation and definition of the milestones and thus project plan with the proposed deadlines. Link to the milestones is [https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/milestones](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/milestones)

*   Actively discussing the design of the rest of the new features with the team members that are responsible for that particular feature
    
*   Bug fixes from old work
    
*   Creation of the release and deployment
    

**Code-Related Significant Issues:** 

All functionality up to milestone 1 and presented in the demo is my work from the last semester. We have not implemented any of the new features but worked on decision making and designing them. However, there were two bugs in the codebase that I have resolved. Those bugs were from the old code and needed to stop them from leaking into next versions. Links to the issues are shared below.

—---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Member:** Nilay Aydın

**Responsibilities:** I actively participated in the creation of the new repository and in defining the coding standards. In the initial meetings, I helped establish the coding and project management standards that the team will follow throughout the semester. Additionally, I took part in the database design meetings. 

My primary responsibility is designing and implementing the [activity engine](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/44) for both the backend and frontend. I am also responsible for addressing minor functionality gaps, such as [deleting](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/33) and [editing posts.](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/34)

**Main Contributions:** I created the use case scenario for the activity stream and actively engaged in discussions about the design of new features with the team members. I contributed to the deployment and release creation process with Cankut. Additionally, I set the standards for branch and PR rules and outlined the requirements for the mobile version. I developed the API for deleting posts and, together with Cankut, deployed the working version of the software to a virtual machine on Google Cloud. I also helped shape the GitHub project and repository structure. Lastly, I prepared meeting notes, though Oguz primarily handled this task, and participated in presentation creation discussions.

**Code-Related Significant Issues:** I reviewed the [PR requests](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/pull/46) of Cankut’s bug fixes.

**Non-Code Related Significant Issues:** I created the defining [branch and PR standards](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/31), and refined the [mobile version requirements](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/wiki/Requirements#mobile-requirements), and established [commit standards](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/7) for the project. Additionally, I reviewed [Ahmet Ozmus's Pull Request](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/pull/30), which focused on refactoring the project, ensuring the changes aligned with our project structure and coding standards.

**Responsibilities:** In the first meeting we talked about how we will work collaboratively, how we manage the repository, what will be our branch protection rules, what will be our development strategy in the same repository etc. My responsibilities in the initial phase were researching and implementing branch protection rules, providing coding standards for both backend and frontend, designing ER diagrams for new features on top of existing ones, and designing invitation system mockup scenarios.

**Main Contributions:** As it is my first task, I took the task which I need to deep dive into branch protection rules. We basically set the rules in the meeting but Github suggests using the new Ruleset system to set more advanced rules. I did some research on it and created new Rulesets for our two main branches. Then, we talked about our coding standard as a group and decided to apply the coding standard that I have been using in a project at work. I implemented the ER design after a meeting that we decided how recommendation and activity streams systems will be with Nilay and Cankut. I determined requirements for the invitation system and designed mockup scenarios.

**Responsibilities:** A general description of the responsibilities assigned to you.

**Main Contributions:** My primary contributions were focused on implementing post interaction features (upvotes and downvotes), refactoring backend code for better organization, and contributing to the overall system design. Although the upvote and downvote functionality is not fully completed yet, I have laid the groundwork for both backend and frontend components and expect these to be finalized soon. Additionally, I worked on the design aspect of the recommendation system and related documentation.

**Code-Related Significant Issues:** I worked on multiple aspects of the project, focusing on the implementation of post upvote and downvote functionality across both the backend and frontend, and a significant backend refactor. On the backend, I began implementing the logic for upvoting and downvoting posts, including creating API endpoints, integrating the database, and building core logic to track user interactions, though testing and full frontend integration are still pending. On the frontend, I developed the UI components for displaying upvote/downvote buttons and linked them to the backend, with dynamic updates and testing in progress. Additionally, I completed a refactor of the backend package structure, applying clean code principles to improve modularity and maintainability. The links to issues are as follows.

**Non-Code Related Significant Issues:** 

**Create Use Case Diagram for Recommendation System**

*   **Issue Link**: [https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/15](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/15) 
    
*   **Description:** Created a use case diagram to illustrate how the recommendation system interacts with users and the overall system. This diagram provides a visual reference for how the system will personalize content based on user interactions and preferences.
    

**Mockup: Recommendation Pages**

*   **Issue Link**: [https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/12](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/issues/12) 
    
*   **Description:** Initially, I designed the mockups for the recommendation pages to outline how personalized content would be presented to users. These mockups established the visual framework for the recommendation system and provided guidance to the frontend design team. Later, I collaborated with a team member to update the mockups, incorporating their feedback to improve the layout and user experience.

**Member:** MEHMET OĞUZ ÖZÜER

**Responsibilities:** I have several key responsibilities in this project. As the project began with the establishment of infrastructure and repository, I set up the foundation for the team, including the creation of a well-organized Wiki structure. This ensures that the team has a solid framework for collaboration and documentation.

One of my primary roles has been the requirements elicitation process, where I worked on determining the system, user, and community requirements. I also focused on the commenting system, defining its necessary features. Alongside this, I’ve taken on the responsibility of maintaining the repository’s Wiki, including issue templates and the management of some issues (after deciding as a group who is going to do what). This includes taskification, where I create issues that define responsibilities for the group members.

In terms of development, I am responsible for both the back-end and front-end implementation of the comment section, ensuring that features like deletion and edit are functioning correctly. I am also contributing to the design process by creating mock-ups and scenarios to guide the team’s development.

**Main Contributions:** 

1.   Establishment of infrastructure and repository.
    
2.   Establishment of Wiki-structure.
    
3.    Requirements Elicitation and Determining Requirements for System, User, Community, Commenting.
    
4.   Maintenance of repository Wiki, issue templates and issues (not all of them, ones that are decided and need to be created). This includes creating issues for segregated responsibilities for the group (Taskification). 
    
5.  Mock-ups and Scenarios

**SOFTWARE**

Release Name: 0.1.0-alpha (pre-release option) => [https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/releases/tag/customer-milestone-1](https://github.com/SWE574-G3/SWE-574-G3/releases/tag/customer-milestone-1)

**CUSTOMER FEEDBACK**

Following the customer feedback, we recognized the need to revise the mockups for the activity stream, as they did not fully capture or communicate the intended user interactions. The feedback pointed out that the redirection functionality was unclear. For instance, when user A likes post B, clicking on user A’s name should take the user to their profile, while clicking on post B should navigate to the actual post that was liked. Although this was what we originally envisioned for the feature, we hadn’t successfully conveyed this concept through our mockups. As a result, we will be updating the mockups to more clearly illustrate this interaction, ensuring that the redirection within the activity stream is intuitive and functions as expected.

In addition to this, we decided to enhance the post template creation process by adding boolean values, giving users more control over template customization. These boolean options will allow users to make selections during the creation phase, further refining the flexibility of the system.

Moreover, some of the feedback we received pertained to the demonstration rather than the functionality of the system itself. During the demo, it became evident that our post templates could have been designed in a way that better demonstrated their purpose and functionality. We realized that by making the templates more descriptive and illustrative, we could help users better grasp the key features of the system. As a result, we will be implementing this feedback and making improvements to ensure that our post templates are clearer and more user-friendly in time for the MVP demo. This will not only enhance the user experience but also ensure that future demonstrations more effectively showcase the system’s capabilities.
